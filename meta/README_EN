<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
privacyIDEA is installed with a default configuration for users and administrators.
privacyIDEA provides a web UI, where normal users and administrators can login.
</p>
<p>
Users can login with their username and their domain password.
</p>
<p>
Administrators need to login with <em>&lt;adminname&gt;@admin</em> and their domain password, to get administrative rights.
</p>
<p>
At the command line the tool <em>pi-manage</em> can be used to manage additional administrators that are independent of the LDAP directory.
</p>
<p>
privacyIDEA uses MySQL to store the token information and
the Apache webserver to provide a management UI and a REST API.
</p>
